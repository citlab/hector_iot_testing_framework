# Héctor Framework
This folder contains the Héctor API with all necessary functions and data structures to do application testing in (virtual or real) IoT environments.
'hospital_experiment_net.py' and the .properties files contain example code on how to use the framework. A Kernel and device tree for Raspberry Pi virtualization is also provided in this folder. To facilitate automated communication with virtual (and real) devices, RSA key pairs are necessary.
